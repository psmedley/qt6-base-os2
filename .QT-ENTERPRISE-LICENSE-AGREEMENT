(ii) Customer shall not remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice(s) contained in any portion of the Licensed Software;
(iii)  Applications must add primary and material functionality to Licensed Software so as not to compete with the Licensed Software;
(iv)   Applications may not pass on functionality which in any way makes it possible for others to create software with Licensed Software; provided however that Customer may use Licensed Software’s scripting and QML ("Qt Quick") functionality solely in order to enable scripting, themes and styles that augment the functionality and appearance of the Application(s) without adding primary and substantial functionality to the Application(s);
(v) Customer shall not use Licensed Software in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Right or right of any third party, or that violates any applicable law;
(vi) Customer shall not use The Qt Company's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market Applications, except that Customer may use “Built with Qt” logo to indicate that an Application or Device was developed using Licensed Software;
(vii) Customer shall not distribute, sublicense or disclose source code of Licensed Software to any third party (provided however that Customer may appoint employee(s) of Contractors and Affiliates as Designated Users to use Licensed Software pursuant to this Appendix).
(viii) Customer shall not grant the End Customers a right to: (a) make copies of the Redistributables except when and to the extent required to use the Applications and/or Devices for their intended purpose; (b) modify the Redistributables or create derivative works thereof; (c) decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer Redistributables; or (d) redistribute any copy or portion of the Redistributables to any third party, except as part of the onward sale of the Application or Device on which the Redistributables are installed;
(ix) Customer shall not and shall cause that its Affiliates, Contractors or End Customers shall not, use Licensed Software in any Prohibited Combination, unless Customer has received specific advance written permission from The Qt Company to do so.

5.5. Evaluation License
5.5.1. Subject to the terms of this Appendix, The Qt Company grants to Customer a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, valid for the Evaluation License Term to use the relevant Licensed Software product solely for Customer’s internal use to evaluate and determine whether the Licensed Software meets Customer's business requirements, specifically excluding any commercial use of the Licensed Software or any derived work thereof.
5.5.2. Upon the expiry of the Evaluation License Term, Customer must either discontinue use of the relevant Licensed Software or acquire a commercial Development License.

6. THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. The Licensed Software may provide links or access to third party libraries or code (collectively "Third-Party Software") to implement various functions.

Pre-Release Code may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially modified by The Qt Company prior to a commercial product release, if any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make Pre-Release Code commercially available or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Qt assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any Pre-Release Code and any use thereof is exclusively at Customer’s own risk and expense.
7.3. Unless Licensed Software specifies different license terms for the respective Pre-Release Code, Customer is entitled to use such Pre-Release Code pursuant to Section 5 of this Appendix.

10. RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS
10.1. Customer’s Record-keeping
10.1.1. Customer shall at all times during the term of the Agreement or validity of any of the licenses hereunder, whichever is later, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, maintain Customer’s Records in an accurate and up-to-date form.

The records shall conform to general good accounting practices.
10.1.2. Customer shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company’s request to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report based on Customer’s Records, such report to contain information, in sufficient detail, on: (i) number and identity of users working with Licensed Software or Qt Community Edition, (ii) Devices distributed by Customer during the most recent calendar quarter and/or any other term specified by The Qt Company, and (iii) any other information pertaining to Customer’s compliance with the terms of the Agreement (e.g. information on products and/or projects relating to use of Licensed Software), as The Qt Company may reasonably require from time to time.
10.2. The Qt Company’s Audit Rights
10.2.1. The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company may, upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and at The Qt Company expense, audit Customer with respect to Customer’s use of the Licensed Software, but not more frequently than once during each six (6) month period. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Customer’s place of business. Any possible in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Customer's facilities, shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities and shall be limited in scope to verify Customer’s compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

All Customer’s Records and use thereof shall be subject to the obligation of confidentiality under the Agreement.
10.2.2. If an audit reveals that Customer is using the Licensed Software beyond the scope of the licenses Customer has paid for, Customer shall pay to The Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use within thirty (30) days from receipt of the corresponding invoice from The Qt Company.
10.2.3. In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms of the Agreement (without limitation, either (i) underpayment of more than 10% of License Fees or 10,000 Euros (whichever is more) or (ii) distribution of products, which include or result from Prohibited Combination, shall be deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then Customer shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.

11. TERMINATION
11.1. Termination of Licenses
11.1.1. The Qt Company may terminate Customer’s rights to any and all Licensed Software (including access to Support), if Customer:
(i) commits a material breach of the Agreement (including this Appendix) and has not remedied the breach within a reasonable period of time (which shall be no less than thirty (30) days) of The Qt Company’s written notice specifying the breach, or
(ii) becomes bankrupt, insolvent or goes into liquidation or debt restructuring.
11.1.2. Suspension of rights: Instead of termination, The Qt Company reserves the right to suspend or withhold grants of any and all rights to the Licensed Software (including Support), should Customer fail to make payment in timely fashion or otherwise violate or is reasonably suspected of violating its obligations under the Agreement and/or this Appendix, and where such violation or breach is not cured within ten (10) business days following The Qt Company’s written notice thereof.

11.2.2. Upon such expiry or termination of Development Licenses, Customer shall destroy or return to The Qt Company all copies of the respective Licensed Software and all related materials and will certify the same by Customer’s duly authorized officer to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that Customer may retain and utilize such copies of the Licensed Software to the extent required to provide Customer’s continued support to End Customers, for archiving purposes or as is required under applicable law.
11.2.3. Upon expiry of Distribution Licenses, Customer shall cease (including via its Affiliates and Contractors) distribution of Devices.
11.2.4. If Customer’s distribution rights for Applications and Devices hereunder are terminated by The Qt Company due to Customer’s material breach, then Customer must cease any distribution of Applications and Devices as of the effective date of termination.
11.2.5. Expiry or termination of any of Customer’s licenses hereunder for any reason whatsoever shall not:
(i) relieve Customer of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Customer shall pay to The Qt Company all such fees within thirty (30) days from the effective date of termination of the licenses;
(ii) relieve Customer of its obligation to ensure that Customer’s actions or inactions do not cause Applications and Devices (including those already distributed) to fall out of compliance with the terms of the Agreement; nor
(iii) affect any rights of End Customer to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated Redistributables) received by the End Customer before the date of such expiry or termination of Customer’s rights.
11.3. Extension of Rights under Special Circumstances. In the event that, during the applicable License Term, The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable decision by relevant court of law, and the Agreement is not, at the date of expiry of the Development License(s), assigned to a party who has assumed The Qt Company’s position as a legitimate licensor of Licensed Software under the Agreement, then all valid Development Licenses possessed by Customer at such date of expiry, and which Customer has not notified for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of the Agreement. Any such extension shall not apply to The Qt Company’s Support obligations.

EXHIBIT 2 – Small Business Terms

1. This Exhibit applies to entities that qualify as a Qualified Small Business (defined below) and provides additional terms and conditions applicable to small business pricing and licensing. In the event that Customer is a Qualified Small Business and there is any conflict between the terms of this Exhibit and any other terms of the Agreement, the terms in this Exhibit shall take precedence.
2. APPLICABILITY FOR SMALL BUSINESS LICENSES. Any small business discounts applied require that Customer (including any Customer Affiliates or group entities) has an annual revenue (including annual capital funding) below 1 Million EUR, or the equivalent thereof, as approved by The Qt Company (each, a “Qualified Small Business”). The annual revenue, including funding, must be evidenced upon request by business records and approved by The Qt Company in its reasonable discretion.
3. SUPPORT. Support is limited to: (i) Install Support; and (ii) for any other Standard Support issue, five (5) support tickets annually.
4. LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPER LICENSES. Qualified Small Business discounts and purchasing structure may be applied to a maximum of three discounted developer licenses (either ADE or DCP) per Qualified Small Business. Any additional licenses purchased will be at The Qt Company list price in effect at the time.
5. LIMITATION FOR NUMBER OF INSTALLATIONS. Customer may install copies of the Licensed Software on two (2) computers per Designated User, provided that only the Designated Users who have a valid Development License may use the Licensed Software.
6. CONDITIONAL WAIVER OF DISTRIBUTION LICENSES. For Qualified Small Businesses, the Agreement requirements to purchase Distribution Licenses for Devices shall apply only when Customer ceases to be a Qualified Small Business (e.g., when annual revenue thresholds are bypassed).
7. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR RENEWALS. The initial subscription purchase term for Qualified Small Business Licenses is twelve (12) months. Upon expiration of the initial twelve (12) month term, Customer’s Qualified Small Business Licenses may be renewed with applicable Qualified Small Business pricing so long as Customer remains a Qualified Small Business and accepts The Qt Company’s terms and conditions at the time of renewal. If Customer ceases to be a Qualified Small Business, renewal pricing shall be at The Qt Company list price in effect at the time of renewal, or as agreed in writing between the parties.
8. ADDITIONAL AUDIT RIGHTS. In addition to the audit rights set forth in the Agreement, The Qt Company reserves the right to audit Customer financial records in order to determine whether Customer is a Qualified Small Business.
