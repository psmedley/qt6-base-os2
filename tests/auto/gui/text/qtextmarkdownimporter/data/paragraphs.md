This paragraph has enough text to auto-wrap when QTextMarkdownWriter writes it
to a markdown file. The wrapping should be around 80 columns.

This paragrah has been broken up into shorter lines.
Each line break is created
by hitting shift-enter in QTextEdit.
But it's treated as one QTextBlock.

This paragraph also has short lines. Each ends with a Unicode LineSeparator.
