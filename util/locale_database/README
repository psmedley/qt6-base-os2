locale_database is used to generate qlocale data from CLDR.

CLDR is the Common Locale Data Repository, a database for localized
data (like date formats, country names etc).  It is provided by the
Unicode consortium.

See cldr2qlocalexml.py for how to run it and qlocalexml2cpp.py to
update the locale data tables (principally text/qlocale_data_p.h,
time/q*calendar_data_p.h and time/qtimezone*_data_p.h under
src/corelib/). See enumdata.py and zonedata.py for when and how to
update the data they provide. You shall definitely need to pass
--no-verify or -n to git commit for these changes.

NOTE: on Windows it is advisable to set the environment variable
PYTHONUTF8 to 1 before running the scripts to avoid encoding errors.
